Victory Sunburst
=============

`victory-sunburst` draws an SVG sunburst chart with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3). Styles and data can be customized by passing in your own values as properties to the component. Data changes are (not yet) animated with [victory-animation](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-animation).

##Examples

The plain component has baked-in sample data and defaults, so rendering the sunburst with no custom properties, like so:

``` javascript
<VictorySunburst/>
```

Will look like this:
